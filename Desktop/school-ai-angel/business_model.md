## The African Market Reality

### Payment Barriers
- ❌ **No Visa/Mastercard** - Most schools/teachers lack international payment cards
- ❌ **Complexity** - "Buy tokens" or prepaid credits too confusing
- ❌ **Low budgets** - Schools operating on <$1000/year total budget
- ✅ **Mobile money** - M-Pesa, Airtel Money widely adopted
- ✅ **Government procurement** - Bulk purchasing power
- ✅ **NGO/CSR funding** - Corporate social responsibility budgets

### Competitive Advantage
**Free = Unstoppable Growth**
- 2-5% typical freemium conversion in EdTech
- In Africa, conversion could be <1% due to payment barriers
- **Solution**: Don't depend on school payments at all

## Cloud Storage Economics (Supabase Free Tier)

### The 500MB Problem

**Supabase free tier**: 500MB storage per project

**Your platform** (per school):
- Student records: ~5KB each × 500 students = 2.5MB
- AI results cache: ~100KB/day × 30 days = 3MB
- Messages/notifications: ~50KB/day × 30 days = 1.5MB
- Total per school: ~7MB/month

**Capacity**: 500MB ÷ 7MB = ~70 schools per free project

**Solutions**:

#### Option 1: Multi-Tenancy Optimization
- Aggressive data compression
- Prune old AI results (>90 days)
- Store media externally (Cloudflare R2 free tier)
- **Result**: 200-300 schools per free project

#### Option 2: School Federation Model
- Each school gets own Supabase project (free)
- They own their data
- You provide central coordination
- **Result**: Unlimited schools, $0 cost

#### Option 3: Growth-Triggered Migration
- Start free tier
- At 80% capacity, apply for:
  - NGO grant ($50K)
  - Government partnership
  - Sponsor funding
- **Result**: Pay for Supabase Pro ($25/month) once revenue secured

## Next Actions (This Week)

1. **Implement Hybrid version** (50MB, 512MB RAM)
2. **Update website** to emphasize "100% Free Forever"
3. **Create impact measurement** dashboard (auto-track # students, schools, AI queries)
4. **Grant research**: List 20 applicable grants
5. **Government outreach**: Identify 3 education officials to demo
6. **Corporate sponsor list**: 10 potential CSR partners
